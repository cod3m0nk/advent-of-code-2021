# Advent of Code 2021

Ho! Ho! Ho! I figure I look like Santa Claus, I might as well code like 'im. This year, I'll be doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021). And, I'm streaming it live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/guyroyse).

The plan is to stream each day at 7pm ET, but that may change depending on the day. I'll probably stream earlier than that on Christmas Eve as I'd like to enjoy dinner with the fam. And I might do it earlier on the weekends. Or later. It really just depends. The only way to be sure when it happens is to [give me a follow](https://www.twitch.tv/guyroyse) on Twitch. Then they'll tell you when I go live.

So, if you'd like to watch me squirm and you promise not to tell me the answers, gimme a watch. This should be fun. And exhausting. Hopefully my wife understands. ðŸ˜³

Oh, and one more thing, I set up a leaderboard. So, if you want to play along, enter the code `1502337-516f4c0c` at https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard. Can you beat me? Probably.
